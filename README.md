# Sale-Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Walmart sales using machine learning and time series analysis techniques. The notebook implements various predictive models to analyze historical sales data and predict future sales patterns.

## Dataset
The project uses three main datasets:
Sales Data (train.csv): Contains weekly sales records with 421,570 entries
Store Information (stores.csv): Contains store metadata with 45 entries
Features Data (features.csv): Contains additional features like temperature, fuel prices, and markdowns with 8,190 entries

## Key Features:
Store and Department information

Weekly sales figures

Holiday indicators

Temperature and fuel price data

Multiple markdown columns

Economic indicators (CPI, Unemployment)

Store type and size information

Technical Implementation
Libraries Used
## Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, StandardScaler)
## Time Series Analysis: 
statsmodels (seasonal decomposition, ADF test, ACF/PACF plots)
## Advanced Modeling: XGBoost
Data Preprocessing Steps
Data Loading and Merging: Combined sales, store, and features datasets

## Missing Value Handling:

Markdown columns filled with 0
CPI and Unemployment filled with mean values

## Feature Engineering:
Date-based features (Year, Month, Week, DayOfWeek, DayOfYear)
Time-based aggregations
Exploratory Data Analysis
Distribution analysis of weekly sales
Time series visualization of sales patterns
Box plots for outlier detection
Seasonal decomposition and stationarity testing
